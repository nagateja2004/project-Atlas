# Limitations

## Security and tenancy

- Authentication, RBAC, tenant quotas, signed URLs, and production tenant isolation are not implemented. `project_id` filters are application-level isolation, not an authorization system.
- Local demo credentials do not exist. The service must not be exposed to the public internet as configured.
- Prompt-injection checks and an untrusted-evidence boundary exist, but adversarial coverage and operational policy tuning are incomplete.
- Upload malware scanning, content disarm, encryption-key management, retention enforcement, and formal audit immutability are not implemented.

## Data and integrations

- All EPC documents, equipment, vendors, costs, dates, shipment events, and requirements are synthetic.
- There is no live AIS, vessel position, carrier, vendor, geospatial, weather, ERP, QMS, or P6 integration. Supply-chain responses are explicitly synthetic simulations.
- Computer-vision site evidence is roadmap only.
- Original documents use local filesystem storage, not production object storage.
- NetworkX/JSON is a lightweight prototype, not production graph storage or governed master data.

## AI and retrieval

- Gemini requires a configured API key. Local deterministic embeddings are a prototype and are not managed production embeddings.
- The latest held-out comparison does not support claiming that advanced RAG is better overall. Advanced Recall@12 is `1.0` versus baseline `0.75`, but advanced correct-document, correct-page, and citation precision are `0.0` in `evaluation/latest.json`.
- Synthetic evaluation and deterministic test doubles do not measure live Gemini quality, latency, token billing, or production concurrency.
- Citations reduce unsupported answers but do not replace engineering review. Conflicting or insufficient evidence may still require manual investigation.

## Engineering workflows

- Compliance rules cover the planted schemas and unit conversions; they are not a certified code/standards checker.
- Schedule results are deterministic scenario analysis, not trained historical prediction. The current error result covers one planted 35-day case.
- Commissioning pass/fail and readiness use visible project rules, not certification logic. Electronic signatures and offline/mobile execution are absent.
- Mitigation costs/days are calculated from supplied scenario inputs. They are not quotations, commitments, or approved change orders until a human records a decision.
- The UI’s “UPS-01” walkthrough label maps to the seeded source tag `UPS-A`; this naming mismatch should be disclosed during the demo.

## Operations and evidence

- Queue-backed ingestion, autoscaling, production observability, backups, disaster recovery, load tests, and SLOs are roadmap work.
- Measured latencies are in-process evaluation-harness values, not deployment SLOs.
- Manual effort and hours saved are `NOT_MEASURED`.
- A root project license is missing and must be resolved before public-repository publication.
